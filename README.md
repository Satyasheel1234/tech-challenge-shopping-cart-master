# Tech Challenge - Cart

There are two folders here:

Backend - An Express API

Frontend - A React Application

At the moment they have basic functionality in that you can browse the various products on the store.

## Base Task
Both folders have a readme which has information regarding the main tasks for frontend and backend development, titled `Base Requirement`

## Secondary Feature (Optional)
Each readme also offers an additional item titled: `Secondary Feature (Optional)`. If you're delivering both frontend and backend then the backend feature will require some small changes to frontend but mostly focus on business logic. The frontend feature will require some small changes to backend but mostly focus on the user interface and behaviours. 

Choose whichever tasks you feel will best express your skillset.

## Delivery 
Zip your code and send it to us. We should be able to unzip, npm ci, and run your code and tests on Node 16.
